# Decentralized Cross-Chain Trading System

## Overview

This system provides a decentralized framework for cross-chain token trading, offering enhanced control, privacy, and programmability for users. It incorporates advanced features like limit orders, Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP), Dollar-Weighted Average Price (DWAP), private zero-knowledge (ZK) mempool, and custom execution calldata. The Auctioneer coordinates quotes and manages Solvers who execute trades across different blockchains, ensuring a secure, efficient, and customizable trading experience.

## Main Workflow

### Quote Generation and Request

1. **Auctioneer's Role**: The process begins with the **Auctioneer**, a decentralized entity that generates a quote for the User. The Auctioneer uses data from **oracles** (external price feeds) and **solvers** (agents responsible for executing trades) to calculate the quote.
2. **User Request**: The User requests a quote based on their intended order. This process is interactive, allowing the User to evaluate and refine their requests over time.
3. **Dynamic Process**: The quote generation can occur multiple times, ensuring the User can adjust parameters or submit new requests before finalizing their order.

### Order Signing and Placement

1. Once the User approves the quote, they **sign** the order using cryptographic methods.
2. The signed order contains key details, such as token amounts, source and destination chains, and execution parameters.
3. The signed order is ready for execution, allowing the Auctioneer and Solvers to proceed with the trade.

### Solver Permissions

1. The Auctioneer assigns a **Solver** to the order, granting them permission to execute trades across source and destination chains.
2. **Auction Mechanism**: Solvers bid for orders based on fee efficiency and execution speed, adding a competitive layer to the process.
3. Only authorized Solvers are selected to execute the trades, ensuring the integrity and security of the system.

### Order Execution on Source Chain

1. **Tokens IN**: The Solver locks the User's tokens on the **source chain** into a smart contract or escrow system.
2. **Incremental Locking**: For advanced orders such as DCA or TWAP, the Solver locks tokens incrementally over time based on the User's schedule.

### Order Fulfillment on Destination Chain

1. **Execution on Destination**: The Solver executes the trade on the destination chain using the permissions granted by the Auctioneer.
2. The agreed-upon tokens are delivered to the User's destination wallet.
3. **Destination Chain Guard**: A contract verifies the correctness of the transaction and triggers a **SUCCESS** event, confirming the completion of the trade.

### Claiming Tokens IN

1. On the **source chain**, the Solver releases or claims the locked tokens.
2. For recurring orders (e.g., DCA), this step repeats as each order segment is fulfilled.

## Additional System Features

### Limit Orders

1. **Order Parameters**: The system supports **limit orders**, where Users specify the maximum price they are willing to pay or the minimum price they will accept.
2. **Execution Conditions**: Solvers only execute the trade when the market conditions, as reported by oracles, match the Userâ€™s criteria.
3. **Increased User Control**: This feature offers precise control over the execution price, ideal for Users in volatile markets.

### DCA, TWAP, and DWAP Orders

1. **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**: The User can set up recurring market orders to buy or sell tokens gradually over time, reducing the impact of price volatility.
   - **Auctioneer and Solvers** coordinate the timing and fulfillment of these orders.
   - The system automatically locks and executes trades on an incremental schedule (e.g., daily, weekly).

2. **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)**: The User executes trades at an average price over a specified time period.
   - Solvers divide the order into smaller chunks and execute them evenly across time, minimizing slippage.

3. **Dollar-Weighted Average Price (DWAP)**: The system optimizes trades based on the dollar value of the trade over time, adjusting execution for cost efficiency.
   - This feature is especially beneficial for institutional or long-term traders.

### Private ZK Mempool

1. **Zero-Knowledge Mempool**: The system incorporates a **ZK mempool** that preserves user privacy. It ensures that neither the Auctioneer nor Solvers have access to sensitive User data, except for the necessary transaction details (e.g., token amounts, chain specifics).
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: This ensures that trades can be validated without revealing excess information, enhancing both security and anonymity.

### Custom Execution Calldata on Destination Chain

1. **Custom Actions**: Users can attach **custom calldata** to their orders, specifying additional actions such as token swaps, liquidity pool deposits, or interactions with DeFi protocols on the destination chain.
2. **Solver Auctions**: Solvers bid to execute orders containing custom calldata, with competitive fees encouraging efficiency.
3. **Programmable Trading**: This feature transforms the system into a programmable trading platform, allowing users to chain complex operations for greater flexibility.

## Key Insights

### Enhanced Functionality

- The system offers sophisticated order types such as **limit orders**, **DCA**, **TWAP**, and **DWAP**, making it competitive with centralized exchanges while preserving decentralization.

### Privacy and Security

- The **ZK mempool** ensures User data remains private, ensuring a high level of security and anonymity without sacrificing system efficiency.

### Programmability

- **Custom calldata** adds a layer of flexibility, allowing users to automate complex operations and integrate seamlessly with broader DeFi ecosystems.

### Cross-Chain Coordination

- The process spans multiple chains, facilitated by the Auctioneer and executed by Solvers. Advanced orders and custom calldata support intricate cross-chain interactions.

### Roles and Dynamics

1. **Auctioneer**: Central coordinator, managing quotes, Solver assignments, and verification.
2. **User**: Gains control over trade parameters and additional destination actions.
3. **Solver**: Executes trades across chains with added responsibilities like timing and privacy compliance, competing for order execution via an auction mechanism.

## Conclusion

This decentralized cross-chain trading system is designed to offer users flexibility, privacy, and sophisticated trading strategies. It combines advanced order types, enhanced privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, and the ability to execute custom operations on destination chains. By empowering Users with greater control, and providing Solvers with competitive incentives, this system delivers a versatile, future-proof platform for decentralized trading.
